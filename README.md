Run one of the Matlab scripts "VGM_for_Lotka_Volterra.m", "VGM_for_Lorenz96.m" and "VGM_for_Lorenz_attractor.m". Alternatively, you can also run the live scripts "VGM_for_Lotka_Volterra_live_script.mlx", "VGM_for_Lorenz96_live_script.mlx" or "VGM_for_Lorenz_Attractor_live_script.mlx".

The symbolic (Matlab) toolbox is required.

The code documentation is contained in the folder "docs".
