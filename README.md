# Variational Gradient Matching for Dynamical Systems

Authors: Nico Stephan Gorbach and Stefan Bauer, email: nico.gorbach@gmail.com

Sample code for the NIPS (2018) paper "*Scalable Variational Inference for Dynamical Systems*" by Nico S. Gorbach, Stefan Bauer and Joachim M. Buhmann.
The paper is available at <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7066-scalable-variational-inference-for-dynamical-systems.pdf>.
Please cite our paper if you use our program for a further publication. The derivations of the formulas used in the code are also given in the doctoral thesis https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/261734}{https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/261734 as well as in parts of Wenk et al. (2018).

Run one of the Matlab scripts "VGM_for_Lotka_Volterra.m", "VGM_for_Lorenz96.m" and "VGM_for_Lorenz_attractor.m". Alternatively, you can also run the live scripts "VGM_for_Lotka_Volterra_live_script.mlx", "VGM_for_Lorenz96_live_script.mlx" or "VGM_for_Lorenz_Attractor_live_script.mlx".

The symbolic (Matlab) toolbox is required.

The code documentation is contained in the folder "docs".
